# Skinfo

This is an Android/iOS app that allows users to look up skincare or makeup products from the Canadian Sephora website. Users can look up products by either typing in the search bar or using the label scanner via camera access.
Once the product is found, the app displays all of the products ingredients. Users can then see if there are any ingredients that they are allergic to or that conflict with their skincare/makeup routine.

Data scraped from Canadian Sephora website using Selenium (Python) and stored in database using SqlDeveloper.
App built using Dart and Google ML-Kit library.
